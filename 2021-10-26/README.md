# Seminar on October 26, 2021

## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__   Systems, Organisations, Management
* __Presenter:__ Hans-Gert Gräbe

## Abstract

After the _concept of system_ as the basic concept of our course was outlined
in more detail in the last seminar, the connection to the _concept of
organisation_ as well as to _business processes_ and _management_ are to be
illuminated in more detail.

The seminar focuses on problematising the basic terms _systematic management_,
_organisation_ and _organisation as socio-technical system_. The explanation
follows the conceptual developments in (Sommerville 2015, Ch. 19) and
(Shchedrovitsky 2104).
