# Seminar on November 02, 2021

## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__   PCF - The APQC Process Classification Framework
* __Presenter:__ Piotr Teitlin

## Abstract

With more than 550 member organizations worldwide, APQC (American Productivity
& Quality Center) is the world’s foremost authority in benchmarking, best
practices, process and performance improvement, and knowledge management (KM).

Standardised descriptions of business processes play a special role in this
context.  In the seminar, on the one hand, the specific role of such an
industry consortium in standardisation processes should be presented and, on
the other hand, the systematics of modelling and terms developed in this
process should be discussed in more detail and their relation to systemic
thinking be examined.

__Literature:__ APQC’s Process Classification Framework (PCF), additional
recherche required

## From the Chat

Hans-Gert Gräbe:

- If I understand it correctly, PCF is a framework for business processes
  _inside_ a company, so it has a slightly different orientation than SCOR.
  What is the relationship to BPMN and comparable standards?

- What is the role of APQC in Europe? How does it relate to OMG and other
  standardisation contexts?
  - Ralf: APQC plays an important role in Northern America, but is less
    important in Europe.
  - APQC PCF seems to be more a framework for description of the structural
    organisation of a company and less for the relations between different
    process elements, as BPMN is, that is standardised by the OMG.
  
- Comparison with competitors: For this, the relevant models or data would
  have to be made public. How and to what extent is this done?
  - The standard has the role of a _metamodel_, not a model.  Hence internal
    to a company process models have similar structures, external partners
    have a certain understanding about the structure of the internal
    processes, but the model has not to be disclosed in its entirety.  On the
    other hand, APQC provides consultancy and assessments (?) and provides
    aggregated information from such processes.

- Benchmarking: What is the relationship to processes there? Is benchmarking
  not also a process?

- Content management: Is the content global or how is content assigned to
  processes? In the example, content is assigned to one (or more?) processes.

- Process groups - More detailed grouping in specific contexts is plausible.
  But which four _general_ process groups are delineated?

- What are _key elements_? The term _element_ did not occur in the hierarchy.
  Is this a generic term for category, process group, ...? 

- Benchmarking application: Does this not initially apply to benchmarking
  processes _within the company_ (i.e. Metcalf's Law is not actually
  relevant).  To what extent is the methodological dimension and not only the
  process dimension of benchmarking also standardised?

- Content management application: Rights are important for the visibility of
  content by different stakeholders. This is an essential structural element
  of the system (aspect decomposability), which is in contradiction to the
  process dimension (aspect indecomposability).  At least that was our
  theoretical understanding of the system concept.

- Process Improvement: Modelling the processes is an important prerequisite.
  How to deal with the difference between model and reality?

- Subdivision into 4 levels: What about level 5 "Task"?

- _Category_ in the PCF terminology seems comparable to the term "component"
  in the system context?

- Video: Column "Metrics available" - what is this about? 

- What is the (common) basic metadata structure of a single element in the
  framework?
