## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__   PCF - The APQC Process Classification Framework
* __Presenter:__ Piotr Teitlin

## Abstract

With more than 550 member organizations worldwide, APQC (American Productivity
& Quality Center) is the world’s foremost authority in benchmarking, best
practices, process and performance improvement, and knowledge management (KM).

Standardised descriptions of business processes play a special role in this
context.  In the seminar, on the one hand, the specific role of such an
industry consortium in standardisation processes should be presented and, on
the other hand, the systematics of modelling and terms developed in this
process should be discussed in more detail and their relation to systemic
thinking be examined.
