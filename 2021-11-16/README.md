## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__ Conceptual Systems and Coordination Processes in Agent-based
  Business Systems
* __Presenter:__ Stefan HÃ¤rtel

## Abstract

While classical business and management theories focus on managers with
sufficient authority, in our seminar we are mainly interested in business
processes in multi-stakeholder environments, where such interventional power
is usually not available. This is typical for prosumer approaches, where value
production is distributed between provider and customer. The agent-based
approach addresses such a distributed decision-making and responsibility
environment. The special features of the concepts compared to classical
business process approaches are to be worked out.
