## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__ Service and Value in the Interactive Business Landscape

* __Presenter:__ Gr√§be

## Abstract

In the previous seminars, strategic corporate planning (business model design)
was considered from the perspective of an individual company and its world
conceptualisation.  However, these world conceptualisations are in turn
interdependent and lead to _practical dependencies_ between the execution of
the individual business models.  These dependencies can in turn be
conceptualised, leading to systemic development processes at the inter-company
level.

This further dimension of cooperative action is addressed in (Ford, Mouzas
2013) taking the perspective of a rigorous developmental approach, as is also
the case with our concept of Cooperative Action.
