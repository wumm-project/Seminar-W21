* __Presenter:__ Gr√§be

## Abstract

Classical Business Process approaches are focused on process management in
production structures where classical products are produced that can be sold
as tangible goods on the market. In the last 50 years, however, production
structures for services have gained enormous importance. The associated
structural change in society, which has taken place and is taking place in
different ways in all western industrialised countries, is also referred to as
the __transition to a service society__. The lecture will examine and present
which differences and new aspects arise in the field of BP modelling and
management of such service-oriented structures.
