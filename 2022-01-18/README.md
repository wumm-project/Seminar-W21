## Abstract


Slide 5:
- x-axis: TRIZ - tool -> acts on -> object
- y-axis: these are four levels of systemic abstraction?

Slide 6: Stakeholder - The data protection officer represents a business
restriction, so this is rather non-functional.  Relationship with the ABER
matrix of ProHEAL.

Slide 7: BPDM - we encountered other conceptual worlds, APQC PCF, in two weeks
also ISO 56000 (it contains also references to other ontologies, such as ISO
9000). How do they relate to each other?

What about the further development of the technology base of the enterprise?
Doesn't it also depend on the "world"?  In CMMI, this only occurs at level 5.

What about maturity levels of Business Modelling in general?

All is about customers in B2C - what role play _business_ customers (B2B) and
their business models?

VDML - how does this relate to the APQC PCF?

Slide 34:
1. TRIZ in the modelling phase when it comes to determining MPV.
2. TRIZ as a system transformation project.

Slide 40: Viewing this as tetrahedron would be very exciting. First, a fourth
side has to be added. Further, the relation between one corner with the
opposite side could be understood as a relation to the connection of the other
three corners.

Slide 44: TRIZ principle 25 means "by itself". Self service always needs a
managed infrastructure. From one perspective it is outsourcing, from another
it is a prosumer approach. The latter plays a dominant role in the B2B sector.
Example: Managing a Wordpress instance. In computer science this is well known
under the keyword _service levels_.

Slide 48: Stefan Schaper comes from the TRIZ scene (TRIZ Level 4, gave a
presentation on "TRIZ-inspired generation of digital business models" at the
[German TRIZOnline Conference 2020](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/conferences.php?conference=http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/rdf/GermanTRIZOnline-2020.rdf)).
