## From the Chat 

Slide 5: 
- x-axis: TRIZ - tool -> acts on -> object (from right to left)
- y-axis: these are four levels of systemic abstraction?

It is hard to judge about both points.

- In the example we discussed on 25 January, the focus was on one of the rows,
  the other rows contained only black box information (specification).  Such
  modelling is expected along our systemic understanding (focus is on the
  _interrelations_ between components, the components appear as black boxes).
- All is about the ArchiMateÂ® Enterprise Architecture Modeling Language, se
  more details on their web site
  <https://www.opengroup.org/archimate-forum/archimate-overview>

Slide 6: Stakeholder - The data protection officer represents a business
restriction, so this is rather non-functional.  Relationship with the ABER
matrix of ProHEAL.

- Indeed it seems that the ProHEAL ABER matrix provides more detailed
  structure of requirements, conditions, expectations and restrictions (the
  English spelling of ABER). See

Slide 7: BPDM - we encountered other conceptual worlds, APQC PCF, in two weeks
also ISO 56000 (it contains also references to other ontologies, such as ISO
9000). How do they relate to each other?
- BPDM and APQC PCF address probably different abstraction levels. 

What about the further development of the technology base of the enterprise?
Doesn't it also depend on the "world"?  In CMMI, this only occurs at level 5.


What about maturity levels of Business Modelling in general?
- Such models exist also for Business Processes
  <https://www.process.st/maturity-model/>, mainly oriented at the CMMI ideas
  and terminology.

All is about customers in B2C - what role play _business_ customers (B2B) and
their business models?
- They play a crucial role, see slide 14. The arrows there indicate relations.
  In our systemic approach at such arrows a _specification_ of the exchange
  format is expected to properly operate the exchange and it should be
  differentiated between design time and operational time.  This seems much
  less formalised yet at that point.

VDML - how does this relate to the APQC PCF?
- Also being an [OMG standard](https://www.omg.org/spec/VDML) it is not widely
  used since it is too complicated.
- The same applies to [CMMN](https://www.omg.org/spec/CMMN/1.1/).

Slide 34:
1. TRIZ in the modelling phase when it comes to determining MPV.
2. TRIZ as a system transformation project.

Slide 40: Viewing this as tetrahedron would be very exciting. First, a fourth
side has to be added. Further, the relation between one corner with the
opposite side could be understood as a relation to the connection of the other
three corners.
- This remains a suggestion.

Self-Service: This is not the same as TRIZ principle 25 "by itself". Self
service always needs a managed infrastructure. From one perspective it is
"trimming", either as outsourcing or as burden for the customer (IKEA's
assemble your furniture yourself), from another it is a prosumer approach. The
latter plays a dominant role in the B2B sector. Example: Managing a Wordpress
instance. In computer science this is well known under the keyword _service
levels_.
