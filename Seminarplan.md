## Seminar themes:

1. Processes and Process Evaluation in the APQC Process Classification Framework (PCF) 

   __Goal:__ APQC - the American Productivity and Quality Center - is an
   important cross industry center conceptualising business and management
   processes.  The process abstraction concepts within the PCF and the
   aggregation concepts for business processes both in the structural and the
   processual dimensions (in particular process evaluation) are to be
   explained.

2. Systems, Business Processes and Management in Business TRIZ

   __Goal:__ TRIZ is a contradiction oriented systemic innovation framework.
   Business TRIZ applies the general TRIZ approaches to resolve contraditions
   to business systems and business process landscapes. The main approaches
   and tools are to be explained.

3. Conceptual Systems and Coordination Processes in Agent-based Business Systems

   __Goal:__ While classical business and management theories focus on
   managers with sufficient authority, in our seminar we are mainly interested
   in business processes in multi-stakeholder environments, where such
   interventional power is usually not available. This is typical for prosumer
   approaches, where value production is distributed between provider and
   customer. The agent-based approach addresses such a distributed
   decision-making and responsibility environment. The special features of the
   concepts compared to classical business process approaches are to be worked
   out.

4. Coordination Processes in SCOR - the Supply Chain Operations Reference Model

   __Goal:__ A typical context of distributed business processes is met in
   supply chains.  SCOR extends the classical business process concepts with
   terms that can be used to verbalise, process and evaluate various specific
   problems in such supply chains.  These concepts are to be introduced and
   classified.

5. Business Process Landscaping

   __Goal:__ Business Processes Landscapes address the dynamisation of
   classically static Supply Chains in modern agile distributed production
   systems. The contradiction between profitability and reliability that has
   to be solved in this context represents a significant conceptual and
   procedural challenge. It can only be solved to a limited extent with
   Service Level Agreements.  Experiences and conceptual consolidations in
   this area are to be presented based on the background of the business
   process concepts discussed earlier in the seminar.

6. Schematisation in the Work of G.P. Shchedrovitsky

   __Goal:__ All concepts discussed so far address Business Process Modelling
   as a kind of inter-business verbalisation and abstraction of real business
   experiences. Business organisations as OMG or APQC are socio-political
   bodies to incorporate such real experiences into the further development of
   the concepts. However, in the last semester we noticed that there is a
   large excess of theory building that is never relevant in practice. There
   is a lack of a "theory of theory building", as proposed and practically
   tested in action games by the Russian philosopher G.P. Shchedrovitsky.
   Under his advice structural assumptions about levels of verbalisation of
   corresponding experiences were developed and examined for their viability
   in the Methodological School of Management. These connections are to be
   presented in more detail.

7. Process Improvement Patterns. Exploitative and Explorative Business Process Improvements

   __Goal:__ The aim of all analytical efforts to verbalise business processes
   is to improve them through targeted systemic transformations. _Systemic_
   means the (external and internal) demarcation of an area in the sense of
   our system concept, which is subject to a targeted transformation.
   _Targeted_ means that an "ideal end result" in the sense of TRIZ is to be
   achieved. _Targeted transformation_ means that this goal is prepared and
   evaluated by modelling the system as well as a transition path that is
   subsequently rolled out. Not only Business TRIZ assumes that such
   transformations follow certain Process Improvement Patterns. Corresponding
   theoretical approaches are to be presented and compared.

8. Business Innovation in ISO 56000:2020.

   __Goal:__ ISO 56000 "Innovation management – Fundamentals and vocabulary"
   is a newly (in 2020) adopted international standard in which terms and
   concepts for innovation management are standardised at a sufficiently
   general level of abstraction.  The basic concepts and terms are to be
   presented and compared with the terminology developed so far in the
   seminar.

9. Sustainable Business Model Patterns and Anti-Patterns

   __Goal:__ The integration of sustainable goals into business models is of
   high importance to meet the key challenges of today's society, such as
   climate change, social justice and resource scarcity. To this end,
   companies are increasingly resorting to reflect their business model in
   terms of economic, ecological and social responsibility. Business model
   patterns can support this by identifying proven and applicable solutions
   and by helping to identify potential for improvement.  In addition,
   anti-patterns, which represent solutions that are known to have
   shortcomings, can be used to design business models.  An overview of
   existing sustainable business model patterns and anti-patterns has to be
   developed based on a systematic literature review.
