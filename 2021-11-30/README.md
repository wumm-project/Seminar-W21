# Seminar on November 30, 2021

## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__ Business Process Landscaping

* __Presenter:__ Toni Pfeiffer

## Abstract

Business Processes Landscapes address the dynamisation of classically static
Supply Chains in modern agile distributed production systems. The
contradiction between profitability and reliability that has to be solved in
this context represents a significant conceptual and procedural challenge. It
can only be solved to a limited extent with Service Level Agreements.
Experiences and conceptual consolidations in this area are to be presented
based on the background of the business process concepts discussed earlier in
the seminar.
