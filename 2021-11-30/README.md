# Seminar on November 30, 2021

## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__ Business Process Landscaping

* __Presenter:__ Toni Pfeiffer

## Abstract

Business Process Landscapes address the dynamisation of classically static
Supply Chains in modern agile distributed production systems. The
contradiction between profitability and reliability that has to be solved in
this context represents a significant conceptual and procedural challenge. It
can only be solved to a limited extent with Service Level Agreements.
Experiences and conceptual consolidations in this area are to be presented
based on the background of the business process concepts discussed earlier in
the seminar.

## Remarks

## From the Chat

- What is the difference between Business Process Modelling and Business
  Process Landscaping?

- Organisational chart vs. map - corresponds to the distinction between
  structural organisation and process organisation? But process organisation
  is also the subject of Business Process Modelling.

- Static vs. dynamic? In the flowchart on slide 4 there are branches, on slide
  5 only linear process flows are shown.  How is this to be understood?

- Dynamic BPL. They are used to present different specialised views for
  different roles.  What is the relationship between processes and views?

- In APQC-PCF there are two other structural conceptual levels above the
  process level. What role do they play here (slide 8)?

- How does this relate to ISO 9001 (your handout) and other reference models?

- Support Process = Non-value adding, but absolutely necessary.  How is this
  to be understood? Doesn't this also apply to management processes?

- So BPL presupposes a precise BP model and only serves to explain the model?

- BPL as a descriptive companion to the "living process".  How is this used to
  process the feedback loop between "living process" and process description?
  To what extent is BPL a tool for _developing_ such process landscapes?

- SIPOC - what are the links to agent-based approaches?  In this structure
  (slide 14), contradictions are to be processed.
