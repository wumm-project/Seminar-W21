## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__   Business TRIZ
* __Presenter:__ Michelle Bindel

## Abstract

Business TRIZ is a development direction within systematic innovation
methodologies in which contradictory requirements and problematic situations
in the area of management in companies are considered and the classic tools of
TRIZ are examined for their applicability and need for modification in this
non-technical area. In these developments it becomes clear on the one hand to
what extent engineering methods have already found their way into modern
management. On the other hand, the necessary modifications of classical TRIZ
tools required in these applications lead to a better understanding of
overarching systemic phenomena.

## From the Chat

- Your slides and the handout are in English.  Is it correct that the slides
  and handouts of the seminar are in German?  What language is expected for
  the seminal paper at the end of the semester?
  
  - All written documents should be in English. Unfortunately, this was not
    taken into account in the two previous student handouts.  I'm also
    translating the chat into English afterwards and add essential parts of
    the discussion in the corresponding README file.

- On which modelling level of business processes (company-specific,
  inter-company as APQC) is Business TRIZ located?  What are the basic
  concepts?

- What understanding of business model does Business TRIZ start from?

- Slide 9: How technical and physical contradiction are connected?

- How exactly is the principle of ideality to be understood? How are the
  "values" to be quantified? Why are "costs" in the denominator and not
  subsumed as "value reducers" as in classical revenue accounts?

- Your examples on Trends of System Evolution (general systems?) refer to
  technical systems only? Are there also (special) Trends of _Business_ System
  Evolution?  What is the connection to the topic of "business innovation"?

- Functional Analysis: The system must be delimited beforehand. What
  preliminary work is necessary for the application of this method and how
  does it fit into the overall modelling process?

- Slide 15: What are the concepts behind the individual graphic elements? How
  is the basic TRIZ pattern "tool -> acts on -> object" realised there?

- RCA+ (Root Conflict Analysis) is a further development of RCA (Root Cause
  Analysis) and CECA (Cause Effect Chain Analysis) and not vice versa. Slide
  17 first illustrates CECA, the evaluation with + and - shows the existing
  contradictions.

- The classical Contradiction Matrix is based on the analysis of a large
  number of patents, from which also the Inventive Principles were derived.
  What is the basis of the Business Contradiction Matrix and the Business
  Inventive Principles?

- Example Online Learning in Corona times: The solution leads to new
  contradictions? This solution also breaks down an old static structure (of
  teaching in the university).

- Slide 25: Souchkov later formulated a clear "stage-gate-process" with 4
  stages "defining", "analysis", "generation", "selection". How is this
  connected?
