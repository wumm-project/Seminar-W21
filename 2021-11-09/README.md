* __Presenter:__ Michelle Bindel

## Abstract

Business TRIZ is a development direction within systematic innovation
methodologies in which contradictory requirements and problematic situations
in the area of management in companies are considered and the classic tools of
TRIZ are examined for their applicability and need for modification in this
non-technical area. In these developments it becomes clear on the one hand to
what extent engineering methods have already found their way into modern
management. On the other hand, the necessary modifications of classical TRIZ
tools required in these applications lead to a better understanding of
overarching systemic phenomena.
