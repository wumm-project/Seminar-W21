## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__ Process Improvement Patterns. Exploitative and Explorative
  Business Process Improvements

* __Presenter:__ Alexander Pavlovski

## Abstract

The aim of all analytical efforts to verbalise business processes is to
improve them through targeted systemic transformations. _Systemic_ means the
(external and internal) demarcation of an area in the sense of our system
concept, which is subject to a targeted transformation.  _Targeted_ means that
an "ideal final result" in the sense of TRIZ is to be achieved. _Targeted
transformation_ means that this goal is prepared and evaluated by modelling
the system as well as a transition path that is subsequently rolled out. Not
only Business TRIZ assumes that such transformations follow certain Process
Improvement Patterns. Corresponding theoretical approaches are to be presented
and compared.
