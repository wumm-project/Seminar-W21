## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__ Sustainable Business Model Patterns and Anti-Patterns

* __Presenter:__ Kristin Kutzner

## Abstract

The integration of sustainable goals in business models is of high importance
in order to meet the central challenges of today's society, such as climate
change, social justice and resource scarcity. To this end, companies are
increasingly resorting to the _triple bottom line principle_ (Elkington 1997)
to reflect their business model in terms of economic, ecological and social
responsibility. Business model patterns can support this by identifying proven
and applicable solutions (Smith, Williams 2000) and by helping to identify
potential for improvement (e.g. Fellmann et al. 2018; Winter et al. 2009). In
addition, anti-patterns, which represent solutions that are known to have
shortcomings, can be used to design business models (e.g. Koschmider et
al. 2019).

## Remarks

With the last topics in the seminar, the perspective shifts from _Business
Processes_ to _Business Models_. While Business Process Landscaping focuses
more on the level of the design of _operational_ management tasks, Business
Models deal with questions of the _strategic orientation_ of the company in
order to sustainably secure relevant capital flows and thus the decisive
_throughput_ required for a viable business system.

In the presentation such a perspective was linked with the questions 
- Who is the customer?
- And what does the customer value?
- How do we make money in the business?
- How we can deliver value to customers at an appropriate cost?

In addition to the definition of strategic business areas, it is about
identifying and addressing _solvent demand_ as well as the _cost-benefit
structures_ in the company.

However, business models are only one topic in the field of strategic
corporate management. A second, equally important topic is the further
development of the production-technical basis as the material conditions which
restrict the number of possible business models that can be realised. The
development and expansion of these material conditions requires long-term
capital commitment. This includes the retention and qualification of personnel
who can fill the intended roles, as well as stable supply chain conditions.

This material _aspect of the possible_ is largely ignored in the perspective
of Business Models, which concentrates on finding suitable value propositions,
i.e. identification of (additonal) solvent demand structures that could be
addressed in the context of the _given_ production conditions or can be tapped
by _slightly modifying_ them. Similar to the view on technical systems as
variable bundles of technical functions (see [Gräbe-1]), the company's
production system is understood as a variable bundle of business processes
whose degrees of variability can be used to adapt the Business Model.

Like the patterns of technical TRIZ, BM patterns abstract from these specific
variabilities and claim that a modest number of _abstract patterns_ can be
identified which recur frequently in such tasks to design a transformation of
a Business Model as a system of value propositions.

Thus, we also here encounter the three levels of _systemic reality_,
_domain-specific modelling_ and _cross-domain methodology_, as described in
[Gräbe-2] for the TRIZ ontology project.

In the presentation itself, the area was explored using the example of the
topic of _sustainability_ as a new component of value proposition to be
integrated into existing BM. With the anchoring of the topic in public
awareness, it increasingly plays a role as an (additional) value proposition.

## From the Chat

Business model: What role play the _conditions of production_ (besides the
labour processes in which the value proposition is practically realised)?

Thesis: Up to now, (capitalist) economic activity has been based on the
assumption that nature is available without restriction and free of charge
("exploited").

Note that this assumption becomes problematic in economic theory when it comes
to extractive industries (including agriculture).

How do the SDGs (which are the result of a longer global _political_ process)
fit into a narrower economic theory?

How to deal with the "Paris gap", which is currently assigned a central
importance in the global climate debate?

Slide 13: Very interesting link to ProHEAL Level 1 (techical-economic
contradiction).  In ProHEAL this is processed in the ABER matrix, whose number
of columns has perhaps to be expanded for this purpose.

Delphi Card Sorting - very interesting approach to produce _cooperative_
knowledge.  Fits extremely well with our approach of systemic development and
our understanding of the formation of concept in their use.

How do the pattern groups relate to another big issue, the transition to a
circular economy? In what time horizons should BM patterns take effect?

G11 Platform - who runs the platform? What are the value flow approaches
there, since a platform must first be built up through capital investment? How
is the relationship between operative and investive capital operated in these
theoretical approaches to Business Model patterns?

How do the Business Models of RelayRide and Uber relate to each other?
