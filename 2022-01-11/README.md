## Abstract

The integration of sustainable goals in business models is of high importance
in order to meet the central challenges of today's society, such as climate
change, social justice and resource scarcity. To this end, companies are
increasingly resorting to the _triple bottom line principle_ (Elkington 1997)
to reflect their business model in terms of economic, ecological and social
responsibility. Business model patterns can support this by identifying proven
and applicable solutions (Smith, Williams 2000) and by helping to identify
potential for improvement (e.g. Fellmann et al. 2018; Winter et al. 2009). In
addition, anti-patterns, which represent solutions that are known to have
shortcomings, can be used to design business models (e.g. Koschmider et
al. 2019).

In the context of this seminar paper, an overview of existing sustainable
business model patterns and anti-patterns has to be developed. For this
purpose, a systematic literature review has to be conducted and the results
presented in a structured manner.
