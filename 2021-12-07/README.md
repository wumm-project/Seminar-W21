# Seminar on December 07, 2021

## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  Schematisation in the Work of G.P. Shchedrovitsky

* __Presenter:__ Marvin Müller

## Abstract

All concepts discussed so far address Business Process Modelling as a kind of
inter-business verbalisation and abstraction of real business experiences.
Business organisations as OMG or APQC are socio-political bodies to
incorporate such real experiences into the further development of the
concepts. However, in the last semester we noticed that there is a large
excess of theory building that is never relevant in practice. There is a lack
of a "theory of theory building", as proposed and practically tested in action
games by the Russian philosopher G.P. Shchedrovitsky.  Under his advice
structural assumptions about levels of verbalisation of corresponding
experiences were developed and examined for their viability in the
Methodological School of Management. These connections are to be presented in
more detail.

## Remarks

In the previous seminars we studied concept formation processes in the context
of description of organisations in general and entrepreneurial organisations
in particular. These concept formation processes are _part_ of the general
formation of systemic structures and are at the same time an essential
emergent _product_ of these formation processes, i.e. they can only be
understood and have effect in the context of the "assembled" system as a whole
and its operation.

We further found out that such conceptual systems mark an important moment of
systemic "reduction to essentials" and thus form the decisive difference
between (simple) immersive and (more complex) submersive systemic structures.

It has been less clear so far how such conceptualisation processes take place
in practice in the interplay between modelling and planning as "justified
expectations" and the "experienced results" of planned action on this basis.

With the AFQC-PCF, we studied an already firmly established cross-company
conceptual system. On the other hand, we observed in earlier semesters that
such conceptual systems emerge as standards from a large excess of theoretical
approaches in a lengthy process of consideration and agreement.

We had also found such diversity in the internal modelling of business
processes (BP), especially in the concept of BP landscaping. In contrast to
the "free conceptualisation" in the course of the standardisation of BPMN or
AFQC-PCF, the processes of enterprise-internal GP modelling take place in the
context of a supersystem in which various conceptual systems have already
established themselves as standards. Nevertheless, we have seen that a simple
adoption of these conceptual systems for corporate modelling is not possible,
but detailing and varying modifications and instantiations are required.

G.P. Shchedrovitsky has structured such concept formation processes from a
philosophical perspective in more detail and summarised it in the approach of
"schematisation". These theoretical considerations are at the centre of both
the Methodological School of Management as a training institution and the
Organisational Activity Games (OAG - Организационно-деятельностные игры)
organised by him from 1979 until well into the 1990s, which played a major
role in the preparation and transition from a centrally controlled state
economy to more market-based forms on the territory of the former Soviet
Union.

The notion of _schematisation_ is central in Shchedrovitsky's concept of
managerial activity, which he develops from a complex understanding of
systemic relationships. The notion does not appear in the presentation or in
the handout of the seminar that ends with figure 1.2 at (MSM, p. 11) and thus
misses all substantial point which are developen in (MSM) in the further text.

In (MSM) _schematisation_ is first introduced on p. 66 as follows

<blockquote>
What is important is not so much where we sit and think or even how we think.
What is important (this is a crucial point) is what we take as the object of
our analysis, and our actions when we start setting out our thoughts on the
blackboard or the drawing board. The important thing is what schema we draw on
our board, what we represent as our object, what the schema of it is. If we
draw an organisational structure, then that will be the object of our action.
If we draw the interface of group administrative-managerial structures, they
will be the object of our analysis and later of our action. If we draw
production lines, they will be the object of our action. Do you see my point?

The actions of an organiser, leader and manager consist in applying specific
schemata to reality. The object structure that results will depend on which
schemata the individual applies.
</blockquote>

However, it is preceded by conceptual differentiation between

- Organisation, organisational work and form of the life of the collective
  (p. 25),
- the system-object relationship (p. 30),
- the difference between mental activity (Denktätigkeit) and pure thinking
  (p. 33),
- the concept of practice of thinking (p. 52),
- the connection between problem, problematisation and systems analysis
  (p. 63)

to finally arrive at the difference between roles and role occupations ("the
administrative-organisational structure of places", p. 64).  This is unfolded
in two concepts of the notion _system_, from which "the art of schematisation"
(p. 101) is derived. In a next step the question is discussed how such
systemic planning ultimately translates into practical action (transition to
activity, implementation, processes as ways of reading schemata etc.).

## From the Chat

- How are the conceptual foundations (slide 6) related to our approach and
  concept of a system?

- A few words about the content of the MSM book.

- How does the management theory of Shchedrovitsky differ from other such
  theories?  After all, he also wants to teach managers something.

- How is "activity theory" to be translated into German? Handlungstheorie,
  Aktivitätstheorie, Tätigkeitstheorie as suggested from deepl.

  - The notion goes back to Vygotsky's
    [Activity Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_theory). 
  - From English Wikipedia: The goal of activity theory is understanding the
    mental capabilities of a single individual. However, it rejects the
    isolated individuals as insufficient unit of analysis, analyzing the
    cultural and technical aspects of human actions. Activity theory is most
    often used to describe actions in a socio-technical system through six
    related elements of a conceptual system expanded by more nuanced theories:
    - Object-orientedness – the objective of the activity system. 
    - Subject or internalization – actors engaged in the activities
    - Community or externalization – social context    
    - Tools or tool mediation – the artifacts (or concepts) used by actors in
      the system (both material and abstract artifacts).
    - Division of labor – social strata, hierarchical structure of activity ...
    - Rules – conventions, guidelines and rules regulating activities in the
      system      
  - Translated to German as [Tätigkeits- oder
    Aktivitätstheorie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A4tigkeitstheorie)

- Transformation is also a central concept in TRIZ (and probably in all
  management theories) - transformation of a system with a problem into one
  where the problem is solved. See the slides "SystemNotion" of the lecture.  

- The excavator example: _private processual skills_ is an important concept
  in the technology definition developed in the lecture.  

- Slide 9: This should be looked at more closely. Is this the classical
  concept of management? Does the picture explain the management concept as we
  had already unfolded it?

- Slide 10: Shchedrovitsky develops a clear distinction and even contradictory
  relation between _leadership_ and _management_ (in the sense of action
  planning), see (MSM).

- Activity Games played an extremely important role in the post-Soviet region
  since at least the mid-1980s (First OAG was conducted in 1979. Perestroika
  started at the latest in 1985, when Gorbachov was elected as First
  Secretary).
