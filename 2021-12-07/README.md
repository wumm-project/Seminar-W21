## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__  Schematisation in the Work of G.P. Shchedrovitsky

* __Presenter:__ Marvin MÃ¼ller

## Abstract

All concepts discussed so far address Business Process Modelling as a kind of
inter-business verbalisation and abstraction of real business experiences.
Business organisations as OMG or APQC are socio-political bodies to
incorporate such real experiences into the further development of the
concepts. However, in the last semester we noticed that there is a large
excess of theory building that is never relevant in practice. There is a lack
of a "theory of theory building", as proposed and practically tested in action
games by the Russian philosopher G.P. Shchedrovitsky.  Under his advice
structural assumptions about levels of verbalisation of corresponding
experiences were developed and examined for their viability in the
Methodological School of Management. These connections are to be presented in
more detail.
